#TODO: could also use 'stat' module (see below) and fail if directories do not exist -> enforce that directories are pre-existent instead of creating them when non-existent (e.g. useful for shared directory)

- name: Create required directories if non-existent
  file:
    path: "{{ item.value }}"
    state: directory
    owner: "{{ common.iotms.user }}"
    group: "{{ common.iotms.group }}"
  with_dict: "{{ common.iotms.directories.onhosts.required }}"
  become: yes
  
- name: Check if required directories are available
  stat:
    path: "{{ item.value }}"
  with_dict: "{{ common.mq.directories.onhosts }}"
  become: yes
